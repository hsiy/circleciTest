# citrusProject
CSCI4830 project

Version 0.2

This version allows a user to open a homepage where they can see a few games coming out soon and have various options of buttons and links to click on. The user can click on the "Find Games" button and is then prompted by a page that asks them to select their video game category preferences. When the user clicks submit they are sent to a 404 page, so our next step is to implement the feature that curates the users feed with games that correspond to their preferences. We have our mySQL database set up and filled with games. To run our application follow the steps below:

1. Set xampp to use
- 8077 for apache port
- 3307 for MySQL port

2. Run citrusProject/src/main/java/com/SpringBoot/DemoApplication.java

3. Open localhost:8080 in a web browser

4. Enjoy
